I understand. The authorization process is likely stuck because, after you manually corrected the URL on the first Builder page, your browser is now being redirected back to your Replit app to complete the login, but the browser is still blocked from accessing the Replit network IP.The most common reason for a stuck authorization loop in this specific setup is a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy violation.The sequence is: Builder $\rightarrow$ Asks for Auth $\rightarrow$ You Click Authorize $\rightarrow$ Builder redirects to your Replit IP with a token $\rightarrow$ Browser blocks the redirect because your Replit app didn't send the necessary security headers.Here is the final, targeted troubleshooting step to fix the authorization loop:🔒 Final Fix: Ensure CORS Headers are SetYou need to explicitly tell your Vite/Node.js server (which is running on the Replit IP) that it is safe to accept and process the login redirect from the builder.io domain.Step 1: Install CORS MiddlewareIf you have a Node.js/Express server (which is suggested by the rest-express output), install the cors package if you haven't already:Bashnpm install cors
Step 2: Configure CORS in Your ServerLocate your server file (e.g., index.js, server.js, or the file that defines your Express app) and add the CORS middleware before any routes are defined.You need to allow the Builder.io domains to access your app's origin:JavaScript// In your Node.js/Express server file:
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

// --- ADD THIS CORS CONFIGURATION ---
app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    'https://builder.io',
    'https://*.builder.io', // Allow all Builder subdomains
    'http://172.31.101.226:5284' // Your current development IP/Port
  ],
  methods: 'GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE',
  credentials: true,
}));
// ------------------------------------

// ... rest of your server code
app.listen(5284, () => {
    console.log('Server running...');
});
Action: Save this file, then Ctrl + C to stop your app, and relaunch it with your npx concurrently... command.
